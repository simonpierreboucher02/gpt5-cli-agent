give me a python code for snake game

Below is a simple, complete Snake game written with Pygame. Save it to a file (e.g., snake.py), install pygame (pip install pygame), and run with python3 snake.py.

```python
import pygame
import random
import sys

# Configuration
CELL_SIZE = 20
CELL_NUMBER = 30  # grid will be CELL_NUMBER x CELL_NUMBER
SCREEN_SIZE = CELL_SIZE * CELL_NUMBER
FPS = 10
SNAKE_COLOR = (17, 24, 47)
FOOD_COLOR = (200, 30, 30)
BG_COLOR = (167, 219, 216)
GRID_COLOR = (200, 200, 200)
TEXT_COLOR = (30, 30, 30)

def random_food_position(snake):
    while True:
        pos = (random.randint(0, CELL_NUMBER - 1), random.randint(0, CELL_NUMBER - 1))
        if pos not in snake:
            return pos

def draw_rect(surface, color, position):
    x, y = position
    rect = pygame.Rect(x * CELL_SIZE, y * CELL_SIZE, CELL_SIZE, CELL_SIZE)
    pygame.draw.rect(surface, color, rect)

def main():
    pygame.init()
    screen = pygame.display.set_mode((SCREEN_SIZE, SCREEN_SIZE))
    pygame.display.set_caption("Snake")
    clock = pygame.time.Clock()
    font = pygame.font.SysFont(None, 36)

    # Initial snake (3 cells) in center heading to the right
    start_x = CELL_NUMBER // 2
    start_y = CELL_NUMBER // 2
    snake = [(start_x - 1, start_y), (start_x, start_y), (start_x + 1, start_y)]
    direction = (-1, 0)  # start moving left (because head is at rightmost)

    food = random_food_position(snake)
    score = 0
    running = True
    game_over = False

    while running:
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                running = False

            if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:

                        direction = (0, 1)
                    elif event.key in (pygame.K_LEFT, pygame.K_a) and direction != (1, 0):
                        direction = (-1, 0)
                    elif event.key in (pygame.K_RIGHT, pygame.K_d) and direction != (-1, 0):
                        direction = (1, 0)
                else:

                        score = 0
                        game_over = False
                    elif event.key == pygame.K_q:
                        running = False

        if not game_over:
            # Move snake
            head_x, head_y = snake[-1]
            dx, dy = direction
            new_head = (head_x + dx, head_y + dy)

            # Check collisions with walls
            if (new_head[0] < 0 or new_head[0] >= CELL_NUMBER or
                new_head[1] < 0 or new_head[1] >= CELL_NUMBER):
                game_over = True

            else:
                snake.append(new_head)

                # Check for eating food
                if new_head == food:
                    score += 1
                    food = random_food_position(snake)
                else:
                    # remove tail
                    snake.pop(0)

        # Draw
        screen.fill(BG_COLOR)

        # optional grid
        for x in range(CELL_NUMBER):
            pygame.draw.line(screen, GRID_COLOR, (x * CELL_SIZE, 0), (x * CELL_SIZE, SCREEN_SIZE))
        for y in range(CELL_NUMBER):
            pygame.draw.line(screen, GRID_COLOR, (0, y * CELL_SIZE), (SCREEN_SIZE, y * CELL_SIZE))

        # draw food and snake
        draw_rect(screen, FOOD_COLOR, food)
        for segment in snake:
            draw_rect(screen, SNAKE_COLOR, segment)

        # draw score
        score_surf = font.render(f"Score: {score}", True, TEXT_COLOR)
        screen.blit(score_surf, (10, 10))

        if game_over:
            over_surf = font.render("Game Over! R to restart, Q to quit", True, TEXT_COLOR)
            rect = over_surf.get_rect(center=(SCREEN_SIZE // 2, SCREEN_SIZE // 2))
            screen.blit(over_surf, rect)

        pygame.display.flip()
        clock.tick(FPS)

    pygame.quit()
    sys.exit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Controls
- Arrow keys or WASD to move
- R to restart after game over
- Q or window close to quit

Notes
- Install pygame with: pip install pygame
- Adjust CELL_NUMBER and FPS to change grid size and speed.

You're welcome! If you want any changes (score highâ€‘score saving, sound, smoother movement, mobile support, or code explanation), tell me and I can help.
