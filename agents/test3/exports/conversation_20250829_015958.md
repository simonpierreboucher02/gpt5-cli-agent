give me a python code for snake game

Here's a self-contained Python script for a simple Snake game using Pygame. Save it as snake.py and run with Python. You may need to install Pygame first (pip install pygame).

```python
import pygame
import random
import sys

def main():
    pygame.init()

    # Game settings
    WIDTH, HEIGHT = 600, 600
    GRID = 20  # size of a single grid cell in pixels
    COLS = WIDTH // GRID
    ROWS = HEIGHT // GRID

    screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))
    pygame.display.set_caption("Snake")

    clock = pygame.time.Clock()

    # Colors
    WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
    BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
    GREEN = (0, 255, 0)
    DARK_GREEN = (0, 180, 0)
    RED = (255, 0, 0)

    font = pygame.font.SysFont(None, 36)

    def spawn_food(snake):
        while True:
            pos = (random.randrange(COLS), random.randrange(ROWS))
            if pos not in snake:
                return pos

    # Initial state
    snake = [(COLS // 2, ROWS // 2)]
    dx, dy = 1, 0
    next_dx, next_dy = dx, dy
    food = spawn_food(snake)
    score = 0

    MOVE_DELAY = 140  # ms per move; decreases as you grow
    timer = 0

    running = True
    game_over = False

    while running:
        delta = clock.tick(60)  # limit to ~60 FPS
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                running = False
            elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
                ndx, ndy = None, None
                if event.key in (pygame.K_UP, pygame.K_w):
                    ndx, ndy = 0, -1
                elif event.key in (pygame.K_DOWN, pygame.K_s):
                    ndx, ndy = 0, 1
                elif event.key in (pygame.K_LEFT, pygame.K_a):
                    ndx, ndy = -1, 0
                elif event.key in (pygame.K_RIGHT, pygame.K_d):
                    ndx, ndy = 1, 0
                elif event.key == pygame.K_r and game_over:
                    # Restart the game
                    snake = [(COLS // 2, ROWS // 2)]
                    dx, dy = 1, 0
                    next_dx, next_dy = dx, dy

                if ndx is not None:
                    # Prevent reversing into itself
                    if (ndx, ndy) != (-dx, -dy):
                        next_dx, next_dy = ndx, ndy

        if not game_over:
            timer += delta
            if timer >= MOVE_DELAY:
                timer -= MOVE_DELAY
                dx, dy = next_dx, next_dy
                head = snake[-1]
                new_head = (head[0] + dx, head[1] + dy)

                # Wall collision
                if not (0 <= new_head[0] < COLS and 0 <= new_head[1] < ROWS):

                    else:
                        snake.pop(0)

        # Rendering
        screen.fill((30, 30, 30))

        # Draw food
        fx, fy = food
        pygame.draw.rect(screen, RED, (fx * GRID, fy * GRID, GRID, GRID))

        # Draw snake
        for i, (sx, sy) in enumerate(snake):
            color = GREEN if i == len(snake) - 1 else DARK_GREEN
            pygame.draw.rect(screen, color, (sx * GRID + 1, sy * GRID + 1, GRID - 2, GRID - 2))

        # Score
        score_surf = font.render("Score: {}".format(score), True, WHITE)
        screen.blit(score_surf, (10, 10))

        if game_over:
            over_surf = font.render("Game Over! Press R to restart", True, WHITE)
            rect = over_surf.get_rect(center=(WIDTH // 2, HEIGHT // 2))
            screen.blit(over_surf, rect)

        pygame.display.flip()

    pygame.quit()
    sys.exit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

If you prefer a no-dependency version, I can provide a turtle-based version as well.

no this one is perfect thanks

## ðŸ¤– Assistant - 2025-08-29 01:59:47

Awesome â€” glad it fits your needs! If you want any tweaks or a different version (e.g., different grid size, speed curve, pause feature, high-score save, turtle-based version, mobile-friendly controls), I can tailor it. Just tell me what youâ€™d like, and Iâ€™ll adjust it.
